    public: 
        AirgeadBankingApp(void){           //constructor function for the AirgeadBankingApp

            private:
                Here we will declare class variables to store calculations and user input
                Decided to make it private because I would only like my class to be able to modify these values

                //Input data
                double m_initialInvestment = 0.00;
                double m_monthlyDeposit    = 0.00;
                double m_annualInterest    = 0.00;
                int    m_numYears          = 0;

                //Calculated data - planning to overwrite these variables with the with and without additional monthly deposits values when needed 
                double m_year[5]                  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
                double m_yearEndBalance[5]        = {0.00};
                double m_yearEndEarnedInterest[5] = {0.00};
        }  

        void inputMainMenu(){
            Here we will print the main menu which will be formatted as such:

            **********************************
            *********** Data Input ***********
            Inital Investment Amount : $
                    Monthly Deposit : $
                    Annual Interest : %
                    Number of Years : 
            
            Press any key to coninue...

            To accomplish this we will need to first print the first 3 lines...
            **********************************
            *********** Data Input ***********
            Inital Investment Amount : _

            Here we will wait for user input which should be on the same line which the data is referencing.
            We will do that for each line until all the fields are filled out, 
            then we print the press any key to continue message so the user can review the data they input before continuing

            **********************************
            *********** Data Input ***********
            Inital Investment Amount : $1.00
                    Monthly Deposit : $50.00
                    Annual Interest : %5
                    Number of Years : 5
            
            Press any key to coninue...

            Here we will save those input values into the class variables along the way
            initialInvestment = 1.00;
            monthlyDeposit    = 50.00;
            annualInterest    = 5.00;
            numYears          = 5;

        }

        void printYearEndBalanceReports(){
                Here we will print two reports one after the other.
                we will first need to calculate the data for the first report.

                AirgeadBankingApp::calculateReportNoDeposit(); --> update the class variables with data not using montly deposits

                the first report will be the report without additional monthly deposits as shown below:

                62 spaces across the whole report
                10 spaces for the Year
                22 spaces for the Year End Balance 
                28 spaces for the Year End Earned Interest

                These spaces will be important because we will want to have our data centered in their respective columns.
                Centered in this case means all the decimal points for the data is lined up
                We will look at the length of our data and print it padded with spaces to the left and right of the data to fill out the needed space.

                   Balance and Interest Without Additional Monthly Deposits
                ==============================================================
                   Year   |   Year End Balance   |   Year End Earned Interest 
                --------------------------------------------------------------

                     2             $1.10                      $0.05            
                     3             $1.16                      $0.06

                Then we will want to recalculate using monthly deposits

                AirgeadBankingApp::calculateReportWithDeposit(); --> update the class variables with data using montly deposits
                Then repopulate the report with different information centering the decimal points accordingly.

    private:
        make these functions private because they will only be needed to when making the reporting, and isn't needed by the user of this class.

            Interest: Money earned based on the “annual interest” rate input by the user. The
                        interest based on an opening amount of $1 and a deposited amount of $50 with an
                        interest rate of 5% compounded monthly is:
                        (Opening Amount + Deposited Amount) * ((Interest Rate/100)/12)

                        Note: 12 is the number of months in a year. Dividing the yearly amount by twelve gives
                        monthly compounded interest.
