Repository assignment from CS Undergrad at SNHU

This has been a great class and a great learning experience. 

I typically use python for all of my projects, so it has been a breath of fresh air to work in Java and C++ more. 

This repository is one of the projects from the class where we implement a banking invetment calculator.
You input initial deposit, monthly deposit, interest rate of the account and the number of years this investment stays in the account.
This calculator is great for understanding how investing can grow your wealth.
AND if you input real savings account interest rates this will visually show you how it's really worth investing in index funds and bonds rather than keeping money in a savings account.

I could have done a better job with the comments and I'm sure there are other newbie mistakes I mad in the program that aren't necessary or proper for experienced C++ developers.
There's no real security with the code as it's a very simple program. 
I typically prefer OOP for my projects, which is why I created a class for my applicaiton. I think OOP really makes things adapatable to change which is what I really love about it. I probably could have broken things up a little more though.
