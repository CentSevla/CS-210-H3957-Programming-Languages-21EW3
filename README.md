Repository assignment from CS Undergrad at SNHU

This has been a great class and a great learning experience. 

I typically use python for all of my projects, so it has been a breath of fresh air to work in Java and C++ more. 
This repository is one of the projects from the class where we implement a banking invetment calculator.

You input initial deposit, monthly deposit, interest rate of the account and the number of years this investment stays in the account.

This calculator is great for understanding how investing can grow your wealth.
AND if you input real savings account interest rates this will visually show you how it's really worth investing in index funds and bonds rather than keeping money in a savings account.
